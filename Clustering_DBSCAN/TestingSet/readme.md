* Eatch row has two dimensional attributes X and Y 
* Output: group these nodes into several clusters. The format is X Y ClusterID 
* Hint: Test1-3 should be clustered to 4 clusters
* Result:
    * Test1: EPS = 0.2, Min_sample = 10
    * Test2: EPS = 6, Min_sample = 17
    * Test3: EPS = 5, Min_sample = 20
    * Test4: EPS = 4, Min_sample = 6
    * Test5: EPS = 0.257, Min_sample = 21
